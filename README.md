# DB2ERD
Database to ER diagram (DB2ERD) is a desktop app that converts `SQL CREATE` statements into `ER` diagram using [d2lang](https://d2lang.com/tour/sql-tables/) for generating the diagram and [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com)(Rust crossplatform app development library) for bundling the desktop app.
